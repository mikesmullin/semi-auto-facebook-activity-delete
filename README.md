Download at [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/16507-semi-automatic-facebook-activity-delete)

A script for Tampermonkey and similar browser extensions that makes it feasible to bulk delete a lot of your Facebook activity in specific date ranges. Facebook tries to make it very difficult to do this so a script helps you stay sane while retaining control of your content.

Remember to backup your Facebook account first. They have a feature that lets you export all your data as static html inside of a .zip file. Do that before running so you don't accidentally lose anything important while you're learning how it works.

**Usage:**

Open Facebook Activity Log, click red delete button. Stuck? Scroll down.
